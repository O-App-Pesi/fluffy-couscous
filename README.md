# Purpose
The purpose of this website is to introduce me as a developer.
# Functionality/Features
## Animations
On the welcome page there is an animation that makes the sections drop down into place one by one. The header and footer also have an animation that makes them fade in.
On the Contact Page there is also an animation that makes the divs behind the form shrink and grow individually.
## Header and Footer
The Header contains a home button, taking you back to the homepage, as well as a backwards and forwards button. The Footer has external links to my LinkedIn and Github. On Tablet and Desktop view, the icons change to column and on mobile they are in a row. Their positions are fixed and they stay at the top right (header) and bottom left (footer) even when you scroll up and down the page.
## Links
Each external page has links to the other pages at the end of the content.
## Welcome
The Welcome Page has links to the external pages in a stylised heading font. These links have the default link styles removed.
## Blog
The Blog Page has 5 posts, each stylised in a unique way using grid display.
## Contact
The Contact Page has 4 coloured divs. A form is set on top of these divs, with a transparent background to show off what is happening behind.
## About Me
The About Me Page has contact information and a link to my CV. At the bottom is a personal description of myself.
# Background
Each page contains a background div, coloured grey which covers the whole page.
