# Purpose
The purpose of this website is to introduce me as a developer.
# Functionality/Features
The website contains 4 HTML documents, each styled using SCSS. Each page has a header and footer with the homepage directing to the external pages which have different information about me. The Header contains a home button, taking you back to the homepage, as well as a backwards and forwards button. The Footer has external links to my LinkedIn, Github and Wordpress. Each heading on the welcome page links to its named page. The Blog page has a list of Blog entries as well as links on the button directing to the other two pages. The Contact page contains a form and links just like the Blog page. The About Me page has a link to a PDF of my CV as well as information about myself, with links at the bottom as well.
